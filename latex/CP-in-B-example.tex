% You can include short sections directly in the main tex file.
% However, for larger papers it is desirable to split the text into
% several semiautonomous files, which can be revised independently.
% This is especially useful when developing a document in
% collaboration with several people, since then different parts can be
% edited independently.  This type of file organization is shown here.

\input{LHCb_authorlist.tex}

The author list for journal publications is generated from the
Membership Database shortly after `approval to go to paper' has been
given.  It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number
has been assigned.  The author list should be included already at
first circulation, to allow new members of the collaboration to verify
that they have been included correctly.  Occasionally a misspelled
name is corrected, or associated institutions become full members.
Therefore an updated author list will be sent to you after the final
EB review of the paper.  In case line numbering doesn't work well
after including the authorlist, try moving the \texttt{\textbackslash{}bigskip} after
the last author to a separate line.


The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb
collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
